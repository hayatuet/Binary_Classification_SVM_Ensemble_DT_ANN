# Binary_Classification_SVM_Ensemble_DT_ANN
This lab task addresses the comparison of SVM, Ensemble Model, Decision Tree Classifier and two layer ANN using MATLAB in term of Precision, Recall, F1_Score & Accuracy. The data has a number of geometrical features of cancerous mole and a binary classification containing two classes. ANN was trained using MATLAB app and then weights are used by myANN.m file.

For more details, please kindly check my the report file, requirements file, and if you want to run the code, run code.m file.
